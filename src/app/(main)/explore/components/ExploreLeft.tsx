        <p>
          All day, every day, we're watching, listening to, reading and
          absorbing politics. It's exhausting. We then report on what we've seen
          in a way that's as chill as possible. None of the sensationalism and
          division you'll find elsewhere. It's about clarity, focus,
          approachability, and having a little wry smile almost all the time.
